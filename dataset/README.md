# Dataset Information

Charity Donation & Volunteer Analysis â€” EDA Report
Introduction

Understanding donor and volunteer behavior is essential for improving the impact of charitable organizations.
This project performs a full Data Pre-processing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on donation and volunteer datasets collected from multiple regions.

The analysis aims to uncover valuable insights that support better fundraising strategies, increase volunteer participation, and improve decision-making for social development programs.

Objectives
Donation & Donor Behavior

Analyze donation amounts, frequencies, and preferred categories.

Identify repeat donors and long-term engagement.

Regional Trends

Determine the highest contributing regions.

Compare donation and volunteer activity across locations.

Seasonal Trends

Identify periods with peak donation or volunteering activity.

Analyze timing effects on campaign performance.

Organizational Performance

Measure campaign effectiveness.

Evaluate the relationship between donations, beneficiaries, and social impact.

Problem Statement
Problem Definition

Small and mid-sized charitable organizations often rely on manual systems (paper or spreadsheets) that cause:

Data inaccuracy

Poor tracking

Limited verification

Low transparency

These limitations reduce trust and make fraud prevention difficult.
A unified Mobile/Web system is required to ensure secure, accurate, and transparent donation management.

Motivation

A digital platform helps charities by:

Enabling secure electronic donations

Providing real-time tracking and impact reports

Reducing administrative effort

Strengthening donor trust with transparency

Project Objectives (System Goals)

Build a centralized database for donors, donations, and beneficiaries.

Support multiple secure electronic payment methods.

Offer transparent real-time tracking of donation progress.

Include an administrative dashboard with analytics.

Implement beneficiary verification using ID, photos, and GPS.

Enable real-time notifications.

Ensure data security through encryption and access control.

Conduct system evaluation for usability, satisfaction, and performance.
